## Current development status

The latest cleanup and implementation passes have:

- moved invoice pages back into the shared station layout,
- replaced MVP placeholder screens with basic usable surfaces,
- fixed placeholder-only station customer and vehicle detail pages that blocked `next build`,
- added active planning docs for the next production development phase.

Before new feature development, run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
```

Log any failures as GitHub issues and link them to the relevant active docs.

## Documentation archive

Completed MVP, intern, POD, and legacy documents have been moved to `docs/archive/`.

Archived documents are preserved for reference but should not be used as the active implementation plan unless explicitly reopened.

## Architectural rule

Every tenant-owned operation must include a server-side tenant authorization check before reading or mutating data.

## Development rule

Do not build new production features on demo-only or localStorage-only workflows. New work should use database-backed services, typed API contracts, tenant-aware authorization, and production documentation updates.

## Testing

Run the web test baseline from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm test
```

The first production-readiness test baseline is documented in `docs/active/18-test-baseline-and-quality-plan.md`. New features must include schema, service, API, and negative-path tests before being considered ready for review.
