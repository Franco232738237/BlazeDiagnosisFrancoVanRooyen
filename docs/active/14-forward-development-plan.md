# Forward Development Plan

_Last updated: 2026-07-01_

## Objective

Move Blaze Diagnostics from a cleaned and partially functional prototype into a production-ready SaaS platform for South African service stations, customers, suppliers, and platform administrators.

The next development phase should prioritize production foundations before adding large new feature surfaces.
