# Page Readiness Matrix

_Last updated: 2026-07-01_

## Purpose

Track which pages are present, which are demo-safe only, and what must happen before they can be treated as production-ready.

## Readiness legend

- `Present` - page exists and renders a basic surface.
- `Demo data` - page uses sample/static/local data and needs production services.
- `Needs persistence` - page needs database-backed reads/mutations.
- `Needs auth` - page needs real role/tenant guards.
- `Production candidate` - page can enter final QA after tests and review.
